  * debian/*.postinst: Resort update-alternatives priorities for the MPI

      (G96) and all-angle constraints.
      (cf. http://bugzilla.gromacs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=261)
    - 51_mshift.dpatch: When running mdrun on multiple processors, it
      will crash under certain circumstances when an error is generated
      but there is no log file attached to that specific process.  This
      was triggered by some incorrect "inconsistent shift" warning

      (cf. http://bugzilla.gromacs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=267)
    - 52_ia64_single_pointer.dpatch: Test for non-zero pointer in IA64

  [ Nicholas Breen ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules, debian/control: Reconfigure gromacs-doc as gromacs-data.
    This moves all architecture independent files into a single package,
    including many topology files formerly shipped in gromacs instead.
    - Rename debian/*gromacs-doc* to debian/*gromacs-data* .
    - debian/gromacs-doc.preinst: no longer necessary, removed.
  * Remove PDF manual for the time being, as modifiable sources are not
    currently available.
    - debian/gromacs.README.Debian, debian/man/gromacs.7: Provide pointers
      to its location online instead.
    - debian/control: Drop build dependency on sharutils, which was used
      only to provide the manual.
    - debian/gromacs-data.doc-base: Remove reference to PDF.
  * debian/control: Add Build-Depends on libgsl0-dev to support addition
    of /usr/bin/g_kinetics.

gromacs (3.3.3~pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Nicholas Breen ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Remove obsolete patches now incorporated upstream:
      50_xtcio_double_range_checking, 51_180_degree_angle,
      52_pme_spline, 53_pbc_compiler.
  * debian/rules:
    - Clean up patch syntax to prevent double compilations.
    - Add .NOTPARALLEL target to prevent the various MPI builds from
      compiling on the same source tree simultaneously, while still
      allowing -j options to be passed to sublevel targets.
    - Improve DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=X handling, now in line with
      the example proposed for policy.
    - Disable FORTRAN inner loops for gromacs-openmpi on alpha.  This
      is a temporary workaround to avoid lingering linking problems
      regarding libmpi.so and the update-alternatives system.
    - Add support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt.
    - Additional rewrite work (see below): use new format for build
      commands, but split for individual MPI implementations.
    - Run autotools between patch and configuration steps.
    - New format for MPI library suffix configuration.
  * debian/control:
    - Add versioned Build-Depends on libmpich1.0-dev for its
      g77 -> gfortran transition.
    - Add Build-Depends on autoconf and automake, and Build-Conflicts
      on autoconf2.13, to support updated mpisuffix patch.
    - Downgrade gromacs-doc Depends: on gromacs to a Recommends:, as -doc
      now ships its own copyright file.
  * debian/patches/04_autoconf_mpisuffix.dpatch: Apply dleidert's improved
    patch to allow arbitrary overrides of LIBSUFFIX; reduce patch to only
    the directly changed code in configure.ac, and add an invocation of
    autotools during the build process rather than patching configure
    itself directly.
  * debian/gromacs-{doc,dev}.preinst: Remove symlinks for package doc
    directories on upgrade, in order to replace them with actual directories.

  [ Daniel Leidert ]
  * debian/control (Suggests): Fixed a debcheck issue - gromacs-openmpi should
    only be suggested on supported architectures.
  * debian/copyright: Added copyright information to satisfy lintian.
  * debian/gromacs-doc.doc-base (Section): Fixed accordingly to menu policy.
    (Format): Fixed path to HTML files.
  * debian/rules: Major rewrite. Changes/improvements include:
    - drop dpatch target definitions in favour of dpatch.make
    - put all configure flags to the top of the file
    - moved all configure related commands into configure-stamp
    - moved all build related commands into build-stamp
    - moved all install related commands into separate install targets
    - configure and build in sub-directories to avoid $(MAKE) clean calls
    - clean target removes build/ instead to run clean/distclean
    - replaced ln with dh_link and gzip with dh_installman
    - adjusted target requirements for binary* and install*
    - install a /usr/share/doc/$package directory for gromacs-doc and -dev
      too; put the HTML into the -doc documentation directory; add links to
      the HTML directory for the gromacs and the -dev package pointing to the
      -doc directory
    - fixed .PHONY target for above
  * debian/watch: Added pre-release version handling.

  * Adding Build-Depends on g77 for alpha only.  (No other architectures
    use FORTRAN inner loops by default.)  (Closes: #360486)
  * Recategorizing to different parts of archive: gromacs-doc to 'doc',
    gromacs-dev to 'devel'.
  * Correct implicit pointer size declaration in src/mdlib/ghat.c, which
    could lead to segfaults on 64-bit architectures.  Thanks to Dann
    Frazier for catching it.  (Closes: #360002)
  * Registered gromacs-doc with doc-base.  Patch courtesy of Drew Parsons.
    (Closes: #359999)
  * Renaming /usr/bin/disco to g_disco, to avoid filename conflict with
    mono-mcs.  (Closes: #360374)
