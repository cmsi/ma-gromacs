gromacs with #MPIPROG# support for Debian
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains the MPI-enabled version of the GROMACS molecular
dynamics engine, compiled for use with #MPIPROG#.  The binary is named
"mdrun_mpi.#MPIABBR#", though it is aliased to "mdrun_mpi".  For non-MPI
applications, use the single-threaded "gmx mdrun" in the gromacs package.

Versions of mdrun_mpi compiled for OpenMPI and MPICH can be installed
in parallel.  In this case, the OpenMPI build will take priority as
the default version (the one that controls the mdrun_mpi alias) --
you may change this with update-alternatives(8).
