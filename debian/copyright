by the GROMACS development team, led by Mark Abraham, David van der Spoel, Berk
Hess, and Erik Lindahl, and including many others, as listed in the AUTHORS
file in the top-level source directory and at http://www.gromacs.org.

If you want to redistribute modifications to GROMACS, please
consider that scientific software is very special. Version
control is crucial - bugs must be traceable. We will be happy to
consider code for inclusion in the official distribution, but
derived work must not be called official GROMACS. Details are found
in the README & COPYING files - if they are missing, get the
official version at http://www.gromacs.org.

To help us fund GROMACS development, we humbly ask that you cite
the research papers on the package. Check out http://www.gromacs.org.

============================================

This Debian-packaged version of GROMACS was assembled by Nicholas Breen
<nbreen@debian.org> and others from the original sources at
http://www.gromacs.org/ .

A detailed list of Gromacs contributors is available at
http://www.gromacs.org/About_Gromacs/People

============================================


GROMACS is free software, distributed under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL) Version 2.1 or (at your option) any later
version. See section 1 for details. GROMACS includes optional code
covered by several different licences as described below.  The
GROMACS package in its entirety may be copied, modified or
distributed according to the conditions described in section 1.
However, in the interests of clarity and completeness, some
individual parts of GROMACS that can be used under their respective
licenses are also noted here.

This file contains the licenses for the following bodies of code:
1. GROMACS
2. Trajectory file reading using VMD plugins
3. Internal FFT (fftpack)
4. thread_mpi
5. Blas
6. Lapack
7. Parts of Boost C++ library
8. Google Test and Google Mock
9. Sun XDR implementation (External Data Representation)
10. Sun FDLIBM (Freely Distributable Maths Library)
11. ThreeFry Random Engine
12. Gamma distribution from libc++
13. md5
14. lmfit

Our chosen method for packaging distributions (CPack) only permits a
package to have a single license file, so we are unfortunately forced
to combine all of this information into a single license file. Sorry
about that.

============================================

1. GROMACS
==========

As our use of the LGPL conveys upon a licensee the option to
redistribute the library under the terms of the plain GPL, we must
include a copy of that GPL for their reference. The applicable GPL
license comes after the applicable LGPL license in this file.

On Debian systems, the full text of the LGPL v2.1 can be found in
'/usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL-2.1', and the full text of the GPL
v2 can be found in '/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.

version, as referenced above.  As an exclusion, copyright for files in the
debian/man/ subdirectory are held by the GROMACS development team under the

If you want to redistribute modifications, please consider that

inclusion in the official distribution, but derived work should not
be called official thread_mpi.

5. Blas
=======

These files are semi-automatic translations by f2c from the original netlib BLAS library.
The source has been modified to (mostly) use modern C formatting, and to get rid of
compiler warnings. Any errors in doing this should be blamed on the GROMACS developers, and
not the reference BLAS implementation.

The reference BLAS implementation is available from http://www.netlib.org/blas

BLAS does not come with a formal named "license", but a general statement that

"The reference BLAS is a freely-available software package. It is available from netlib
via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. Thus, it can be included in commercial software
packages (and has been). We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors."

While the rest of GROMACS is LGPL, we think it's only fair to give you the same rights to
our modified BLAS files as the original netlib versions, so do what you want with them.
However, be warned that we have only tested that they do the right thing in the cases used
in GROMACS (primarily full & sparse matrix diagonalization), so in most cases it is a much
better idea to use the full reference implementation.

Erik Lindahl, 2008-10-07.

6. Lapack
=========

These files are semi-automatic translations by f2c from the original netlib LAPACK library.
The source has been modified to (mostly) use modern C formatting, and to get rid of
compiler warnings. Any errors in doing this should be blamed on the GROMACS developers, and
not the reference LAPACK implementation.

The reference LAPACK implementation is available from http://www.netlib.org/lapack

LAPACK does not come with a formal named "license", but a general statement saying:

"The reference LAPACK is a freely-available software package. It is available from netlib
via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. Thus, it can be included in commercial software
packages (and has been). We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors."

While the rest of GROMACS is LGPL, we think it's only fair to give you the same rights to

However, be warned that we have only tested that they do the right thing in the cases used
in GROMACS (primarily full & sparse matrix diagonalization), so in most cases it is a much
better idea to use the full reference implementation.
